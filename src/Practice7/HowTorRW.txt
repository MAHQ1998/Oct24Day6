Open the file
Read line by line until the end of the last line.

1, create file reader:-
File file = new File("Users/shadman/Desktop/holidays.txt");
// import java.io.file(input output file) and pass in the path of the file
//we can get the file from computer or we can create in Intellij

2. read the first line by using scanner:-

Scanner scan = new Scanner(file);// import java.util.scanner and when the read come out add
                                 // file not found exception by add throw decoration
                                 // Than print
 System.out.println(scan.nextLine());// as we run we get ist line of the text

 3. read all line we can use while loop:-

 while(scan.hasNext()) {  //use while loop to read all the line
 System.out.println(scan.nextLine());
  }

  >>export that to a new file to desktop<<
  >>write in to new file in IDEA<<
  >>export in to empty file in IDEA<<<


  File file = new File("/Users/shadman/Desktop/holidays.txt");
  Scanner scan = new Scanner(file);
  String fileContent="";
  while(scan.hasNext()) {
  fileContent = fileContent.concat(scan.nextLine()+"\n");
    }
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("/Users/shadman/Desktop/newfile.txt");
            writer.write(fileContent);
            writer.close();
